## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

**Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 

**Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

We did this in class it was very helpful to be ran through this because I think I will be using a lot of it on the final project. The streamlit and data pipeline visualizations were very helpful to learn in class. 
In this project I leanred how to create a dashboard using geodataframe. in this HW assignment I learned how to make edits to the visualization, creating different leged options and starting points for the map and data frame. Doing this in class was very helpful in learning how to put different files together and make them work together in the same environment. 
The parking tickets map was interactive, we learned how to filter the map depending on settings we wanted to see. The map was the last part of this HW assignment and it was helpful to see how it all went together by seting up the dataframe how we wanted and editing out information we did not need.
I learned how to start with information, transform it, and end up at my final goal.



Changing up this reflection to send another github commit. My tests pass??
